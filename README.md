# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning
This project involves implementing and comparing five popular classification algorithms on the Breast Cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on a variety of features.

📚 Dataset
Source: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset from sklearn.datasets

Samples: 569

Features: 30 numeric features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

Target: Binary classification — Malignant (1) or Benign (0)

✅ Project Objectives
Load and preprocess the data
Check for missing values
Apply Standard Scaler for feature normalization
Implement the following classification algorithms
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Evaluate and compare models using accuracy

🧪 Model Results

Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	97.37%
Support Vector Machine	97.37%
Random Forest	96.49%
Decision Tree	94.74%
k-Nearest Neighbors	94.74%
🏆 Conclusion
Best Models: Logistic Regression & SVM (97.37% accuracy)

Observation: These models performed well due to their ability to handle linear and slightly non-linear decision boundaries.

Next Steps: Improve performance using hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, or ensemble stacking.

🚀 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy
